## What is it?
Shader-Art is the creation of art using shaders (programs running on the GPU).  
Normally we write a fragment shader which is used to color pixels on a surface and apply it to every pixel on the entire screen.  
We call that a pixel shader.  
A pixel shader computes the rgb-values of each pixel in parallel.  
As input it gets the coordinates of each pixel and any additional values we pass to it.
## How do I start?
[Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) is a good place to start.  
There you can look at and fork other people´s shaders or write your own.
This [YouTube-Video](https://youtu.be/f4s1h2YETNY?si=gq06s93rW1q2WZAe) also has a great explanation.
